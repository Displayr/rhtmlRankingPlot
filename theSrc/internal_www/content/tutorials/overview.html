<h1>RHTML Template Example Tutorial</h1>

<section>
  <h2 class="hidden">Intro</h2>
  <p>The rhtmlTemplate is just a trivial HTML Widget that displays a square with four quadrants.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this repo is to capture a reusable project layout of other HTML Widgets.</p>
  <p>The html source for all tutorial pages is structured in a specific way so that the build tools can generate example R files.</p>
  <p>For example, the html source for this file: <span class="code">theSrc/content/tutorials/overview.html</span> is used to generate this example R file: <span class="code">examples/tutorials/overview.r</span></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Default Invocation</h2>
  <p>By default the widget will draw a square with 4 sections, where the color scheme used is red, blue, green, orange.</p>
  <p>This is shown below.</p>
  <p>In all of the content page types, (i.e. tutorials, examples, regression_suites, and bugs/improvements) we can place a widget config inside a section marked with <span class="code">class="example"</span> and this will cause a widget to be drawn!</p>
